This was cool I guess, had to get used to calculating and writing every shape but could have been worse. Drawing is not my speciality by any means, so p5.js could be a pretty useful tool. That or I could use photoshop.
I also made some line work sketches, but they are lost to the world now. Good riddance

I liked doing these. They made me think more about transparency and its importance in design.

Pretty cool, might stick to VLC though.

## Design

This was pretty fun to make. For some reason I was really having trouble justifying the text correctly, but after that it went really smoothly. I wonder if everyone else's design projects had any kind of rhyme or reason to them. Shoutout to Harry, I liked your car poster deal.
