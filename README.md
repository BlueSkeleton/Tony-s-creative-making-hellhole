## Self Portrait

This was cool I guess, had to get used to calculating and writing every shape but could have been worse. Drawing is not my speciality by any means, so p5.js could be a pretty useful tool. That or I could use photoshop.
I also made some line work sketches, but they are lost to the world now. Good riddance

## Fabrics

I liked doing these. They made me think more about transparency and its importance in design.

## The Video Scene

Pretty cool, might stick to VLC though.

## The Research Presentation

This was a blast. Definitely among the top 5 presentations I have given in my lifetime. It's kinda strange how something usually dismissed as a meme genre can have such an interesting history and evolution process.

## Assorted Purple-Black Knick Knacks

I really like the Purple-Black color scheme. It's really just the aesthetic but it got me thinking: If in color theory purple represents royalty, and black represents nothingness, can this cool color combo be said to represent ruling over nothing? I don't know, maybe.

## The Passive Agressive Game

Writing the code for this one made me feel like I was talking to myself a little bit.

## The Tennis Game

Not much to say about this one, except I realized after the deed was done that you can click on tennis balls you previously clicked out of existence and they will still produce the "POW!" text.

## Design

This was pretty fun to make. For some reason I was really having trouble justifying the text correctly, but after that it went really smoothly. I wonder if everyone else's design projects had any kind of rhyme or reason to them. On the suggestion of my peers, I decided to alter the font, it looks dope now. Shoutout to Harry and his car poster deal.
